### Play here: [poker.kennyhui.dev](https://poker.kennyhui.dev/)

Web-based video poker game with audio and full hand logic.

## How to play

Start by choosing an amount to bet out of your starting $1,000. Once you place your bet, you are dealt five cards and can choose which cards to keep. Click on the cards you'd like to keep and the rest will be discarded. The ones you discard will be redrawn from the deck. The goal is to get the best poker hand you can, and to avoid losing all your money...
